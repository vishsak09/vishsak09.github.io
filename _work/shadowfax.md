# Shadowfax (2021-2022)
**Role:** Data Scientist

## Hyperlocal Allocation System Refactoring

Led refactoring of the hyperlocal allocation system, enhancing serviceability and routing engine components.

**Focus Areas:**
- Made system more modular and scalable
- Improved core allocation algorithms
- Enhanced assignment logic based on location, capacity, and real-time availability

**Tech Stack:** Python, Google OR-Tools, Golang

## Wavenet Time Series Prediction Model

Designed, developed, and deployed Wavenet-based model for predicting service requests volume per client.

**Why Wavenet?**
- Captures complex temporal patterns and dependencies
- Learns from historical patterns at multiple time scales
- More effective than traditional time series methods for daily patterns and long-term trends

**Business Value:**
- Critical for capacity planning
- Ensures sufficient delivery partners during peak periods
- Avoids over-allocation during slower times

**Impact:**
- Peak accuracy improved from 70% to 90%
- Better resource utilization and service quality

**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, statsmodels

---

## Data Science Platform Development

Built platform for real-time Deep Learning model training and serving.

**Key Features:**
- Data scientists can develop, train, and deploy models without deep engineering expertise
- Models served at scale with low latency
- Critical infrastructure for Wavenet and other ML systems

**Tech Stack:** Python, PySpark, Redis, AWS S3
